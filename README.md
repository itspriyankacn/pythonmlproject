Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and other libraries were imported.
After data was collected it was then processed and split into training and target.
A linear regression model was trained and evaluated.A less R squared error was predicted.
The prices was then visualized and used to predict on the training data.
A lasso regression model was trained and evaluated and the same steps were repeated.
We found that the Lasso regression was a better fit compared to the linear regression model.
