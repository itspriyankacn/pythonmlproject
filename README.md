A machine learning model was developed to predict the car prices based on various factors such as selling price, present price, kms driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission and owner.
Regression models were used to make this happen.



Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and other libraries were imported.
After data was collected it was then processed and split into training and target.
A linear regression model was trained and evaluated.A less R squared error was predicted.
The prices was then visualized and used to predict on the training data.
A lasso regression model was trained and evaluated and the same steps were repeated.
We found that the Lasso regression was a better fit compared to the linear regression model.
